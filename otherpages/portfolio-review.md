During the second week of class, you will each introduce yourself to your class with a 5 minute portfolio presentation of your academic work thusfar (you may also present work you've done outside of school if it feels relevant). I suggest focusing on 3-5 projects or courses that were the most meaningful or influential for you.

This presentation is a way for your instructor and peers to get to know you through your work. And it's a great way for you to reflect on what you have done. As you put your slides together, pay attention to:

+ any 'threads' of interest/commonality you see in your projects
+ places/times you discovered something that you really loved, sparked a curiosity
+ things you wish you had more time to explore
+ difficulties you overcame.. or big learning moments...
+ even things you never want to do again...
+ how what you have done so far may have led you to the idea you are thinking of exploring for your Capstone project


Put it together. <span class="underlined">**Practice it**</span>. You will be cut off if you go too long. 

When you make your presentation, ***DO NOT*** include a lot of text on your slides. You should rely on photos, screenshots, illustrations, etc. of your projects. 

If you are in Capstone 2 and continuing your project from last semester, please spend about half of your presentation on this. But also please talk about other work you have done that has been relevant/meaningful. 

***The point of this presentation is to provide the class with a <span class="underlined">context</span> of who you are and the work you've done - craft your presentation with this in mind!***
