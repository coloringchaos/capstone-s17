Although you may look at this document and think [tl;dr](), ***read the whole thing***! I’ve thought carefully about  all of this, and have worked hard to give you both independence and support throughout your Capstone process. The rationales, requirements, milestones and consequences are clearly stated in this document.

<br>

#### Group Meetings
The time reserved for all Capstone classes, workshops, critiques, and activities is Wednesday from 3:00-4:45pm. 

#### One-on-one Meetings
In addition to Wednesday afternoons, we are also scheduled for class M/W 9-10:15am. We will not meet formally as a group during this time. Instead, this time is reserved for individual meetings with me and should be used for individual project work time. I have set up an appointment calendar for Capstone class only. 

#### This course is divided into 4 phases:

1. Research / Concept development
2. Design / Production / Prototyping / Development
3. Testing / Documenting
4. Presentations

Each phase requires different kinds of attention. During the concept development phase, weekly class meetings with your instructor and peers is invaluable. Later, having time to work without a class is essential. So, the curriculum accommodates those different needs.

Check the [Schedule]() for specifics. Some meeting times may change based on individual and class needs and desires.

If you take advantage of the time and space well, you ought to be able to do most of your Capstone work during the scheduled meeting times. Remember, Capstone is just one class. It is not meant to take over and ruin every other aspect of your life. A major objective of this process is for you to learn how to budget and schedule your time and energies over a long term project and still have a life (i.e. sleep, go to a movie, have a relationship).

# Attendance

I take attendance extremely seriously - and because we only meet once each week, it is absolutely mandatory that you are present and prepared for each class. **Missing more than 2 Wednesday classes is a cause for failure.**

Critiques are a very important part of the design process, and I take them seriously. Even if your project is not fully completed, it is absolutely mandatory that you attend every critique and provide feedback on your classmates' projects. It will affect your grade negatively (drop one letter grade) if you do not show up for critique (this includes both days if the critique runs longer than one class period). Work is expected to be completed prior to the critique, do not attempt to finish your project during critique, have everything you need uploaded, tested and ready. Student computers must be shut off and full participation is expected.

# Progress & Major Milestones

Although your Capstone project is mostly self-directed, there will be weekly assignments and mandatory milestones to be met. Here are the major milestones that you all have at the same time:

|---|---|---|
|  <span class="underlined">*February 9, 2017*</span> | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Project Proposal / Approval  |
|  <span class="underlined">*February 22, 2017*</span> | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Project Set (no changing topics after this date…)  |
|  <span class="underlined">*March 8 & 15, 2017*</span> | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Midterm Presentation  |
|  <span class="underlined">*May 5, 2017*</span> | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Final Presentation (to faculty and guests)  |



*The major purpose of a milestone is to make sure you are on track. And they have consequences:*

+ If your proposal is not accepted, you cannot proceed until it is.

+ If the feedback at Midterm Reviews is that there is little evidence of worthy work, or progress, or an evaluation by your Advisor and the Reviewers that you will not be able to complete a substantive, acceptable thesis project–then you will be notified that you will fail. That means you will need to re-take Capstone (which would potentially postpone your graduation). Read this one again now, please!

+ If, at the Final Presentation (that is, the last class), you do not have a demonstrably accomplished project, show little progress, and in other ways do not meet the requirements of a Capstone project, you will fail and be required to re-take Capstone. Don’t get to this point: your parents may be on the plane to come celebrate with you.

Because each of you has a different project, with different internal timelines and needs, after your proposal is accepted, you will make up your own production schedule and assignments. I may make additional assignments or require additional readings for you as well. Essentially the assignment every week is **[Advance Your Project (AYP)]()**. That is, an assignment may say ‘prepare a presentation’, and you must do that, but don’t stop working on your actual project: AYP!

<br>

# Assignments

Part of the idea of Capstone is to both give you a lot of support and a lot of independence. Therefore you will notice that the first few weeks are like any class, with specific assignments. By week 4, you are the driver for your project and your weekly progress will be dictated by a schedule that you determine in advance. After week 4, we will meet as a class every other week, and you will be expected to schedule individual meetings with me in the in-between weeks. 

#### Each week you will receive an evaluation on your progress. Every week = AYP

<br>

# Evaluation

|---|---|---|
|Assignments / Weekly Progress / AYP | &nbsp;&nbsp;| 35% |
|User Testing 		| &nbsp;&nbsp;| 10% |
|Participation 		| &nbsp;&nbsp;| 10% |
|Documentation 		| &nbsp;&nbsp;| 15% |
|Final Presentation | &nbsp;&nbsp;| 10% |
|Final Production Project | &nbsp;&nbsp;| 20% |

# Documentation

There are two distinct aspects to the documentation requirement in this course: 

#### Online Journal / Work-in-progress Blog

Ongoing documentation of your research, your design and production processes, testing, and methodology is a major part of your final Capstone project and serves in lieu of a lengthy written paper. Post a summary of your week’s progress on the blog regularly as the semester progresses. 

<!-- ***Posts are due Tuesday night.*** This gives me time to review it prior to class. -->

Your Blog will be a record of your process during the semester and open for insights and feedback from your advisors, mentors and classmates as you develop your project. It will enable me to get an overview of your work, but don’t do it just to fill out a box or to please me. It is intended to be a resource for *YOU* – a record and reflection of your process, your thinking, your insights. I promise you it will be useful for you to look back on!! I expect you to spend careful time cultivating this online journal, logging ideas and notes. Each post does not need to be especially formal, it should, however, be comprehensible.


#### Project Summary & Formal Documentation Submission

At the end of the semester, you will submit your [semester deliverables](/capstone-s17/deliverables). You will also need to document your progress in an online format of your choice. 


<!-- <br> -->

<!-- # Mentors / Consultants / Feedback

You will get a lot of feedback during the mid-term reviews both orally and in written form. We will go over that feedback together carefully and discuss how you will (or will not) incorporate their ideas. You will post a summary of those decisions to your blog.

You are required to talk to at least 2 people outside of TAM for research, advice, feedback, etc. If there is someone particular that you would like to be connected with, let me know - I may know that person or have a contact for them. Or contact them on your own. People love to talk to students!

Be prepared when you go talk to them… don’t waste their time. Or waste your opportunity for a good first impression!

#### *VERY IMPORTANT: Keep track of your feedback!*

Write down what you hear in your crits as a post. It is a very useful part of the design process. When you are presenting in class, a classmate can take notes for you so that you can concentrate on the crit. -->

<!-- Before any presentation, make a post e.g. Mid-Term Presentation. There’s never enough time to hear all the comments, but your classmates can post theirs as comments to your post, your notetaker can post the reviewers’ comments.. and you can think about the feedback later when you are not on the spot. -->

# Project Requirements

+ <span class="underlined">**Evidence of research**</span>. This includes knowing the field, alternative, previous and current approaches, your audience, how is your project different from other similar things, what are your influences.
+ <span class="underlined">**Cite your research sources.**</span> Wikipedia is kind of a starter resource, a pointer to more primary sources, which you need to seek out and cite. Develop a list of books/articles to read, inspirational projects, experimental work, installations to see, etc.
+ <span class="underlined">**Plagiarism…not allowed!**</span> Be sure to cite the sources of your research. That includes code. For example, if you have dropped in some code from Tom Igoe’s book or class, cite that too. Using work without attribution is not just stealing, it’s leaving the impression that you did all the work.
+ <span class="underlined">**Process documentation on your Capstone Journal throughout**</span>. At a minimum, you must write one post per week.
+ <span class="underlined">**Evidence of user testing and feedback**</span> once the idea is far enough along to solicit meaningful feedback. 
+ <span class="underlined">**Consideration of user experience.**</span> While for most interactive projects including complex websites, 14 weeks is not enough time for a fully-functioning product, you must be able to show a demonstration prototype; and also include user experience specifications such as flows and visual design.
+ <span class="underlined">**Any outside help must be approved in advance.**</span> This includes material assistance on the development of your project outside of class (i.e. design, programming, production). If you need support for an element or two, that’s ok…but at least 80% of the work must be your own.
